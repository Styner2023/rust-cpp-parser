# rust-code-analysis

A C/C++ parser in Rust.

It's a WIP so don't use it except if you want to contribute or fix bugs.

There are several goals here:
 - be able to identify unused macros
 - remove useless includes

It's a spare time project so I'm not super active (it mainly depends on what I've to do during the week-end).
